  blurbLeft: "<p>\n      Dental bridges are a bridge that close the gap created by one or more missing teeth. A great way to replace missing teeth, dental bridges are made up of two or more crowns for the teeth on either side of the gap. Missing teeth make the face appear sunken, cause difficulty chewing and speaking, and often embarrass people. Dr. Castillo and his friendly Fresno, CA office staff work hard to create a personalized treatment plan for your missing teeth, giving you a gorgeous and complete smile.<br/>\n      <span>Benefits of Bridges</span>\n      Dental bridges are a great way to:<br/>\n      - Restore your smile<br/>\n      - Maintain and enhance the shape of your face<br/>\n      - Correct the bite<br/>\n      - Prevent remaining teeth from shifting<br/>\n      - Give you a beautiful smile\n    </p>",
  blurbRight: "<p>Dental bridges are placed over two procedures. During the first visit, Dr. Castillo will reshape the surrounding teeth by removing a portion of the enamel and making room for a crown to be placed over the existing teeth, creating the ends of the bridge. Impressions will be taken of the teeth and you will wear a temporary bridge to protect the teeth while your permanent bridge is being made. During the second visit, the temporary bridge is removed and the permanent bridge is attached to the crowns. Dr. Castillo will check the bridge for fit and look. Permanent dental bridges can last up to 7-10 years.</p>\n    <p>\n      <span>Schedule an Appointment</span><br/>\n      Missing teeth are more than just unsightly \u2013 they can cause speech, bite, and facial structure issues.

  blurbRight: "<p>\n    Lumineers are placed on the teeth over the course of two visits to the dental office. During the first visit, Dr. Castillo will create a mold of your teeth and discuss with you your intended shape and shade of the teeth. When the mold arrives you will come back to the office and Dr. Castillo will fit your custom Lumineers. They will be painlessly applied without the removal of healthy tooth structure. Lumineers are also completely reversible and allow patients to eat and drink whatever they\u2019d like. With proper care, they can last for over 10 years.<br/>\n    <span>Schedule an Appointment</span><br/>\n    If you would like to transform your smile without orthodontics or the removal of healthy tooth structure, contact Dr. Castillo for a consultation.

Dr. Castillo prefers using cosmetic crowns because of their natural look and durability.<br/>\n      <span>Inlays and Onlays</span><br/>\n      Porcelain inlays or onlays are used when the damaged part of the tooth is too large for a filling but too small for a crown. They can help strengthen a tooth that has been damaged, helping patients bite and chew normally. They also protect the tooth from further damage and repairs. An inlay covers one cusp (or bump) of the surface of the tooth and an onlay, sometimes called a partial crown, is more extensive, covering two or more cusps.\n    </p>",

  blurbLeft: "<p>\n      Root canal treatments are used to repair a tooth that has been damaged, decayed, infected, or inflamed. Deep decay or untreated cavities cause the tooth to become infected and can begin to weaken the entire immune system. A root canal treatment can save a tooth that might otherwise need to be removed by removing the infected nerve and pulp and cleaning the inside of the tooth.<br/>\n      <span>Root Canal Symptoms</span><br/>\n      Signs you may need a root canal include:<br/>\n      - Severe toothaches and pain while chewing or applying pressure to the tooth<br/>\n      - Sensitivity or pain associated with hot or cold temperatures, even after the source has been removed<br/>\n      - Discoloration of the tooth<br/>\n      - Tenderness or swelling of the gum<br/>\n      <span>Root Canal Procedure</span><br/>\n      Many patients believe root canal procedures are extremely painful but with anesthesia and modern dentistry it is comparable to having a cavity filled. First, Dr. Castillo will take an X-ray to determine the location and severity of the damage. After numbing the area, a hole is drilled into the tooth and the pulp, bacteria, and decayed tissue and debris is removed. The inside of the tooth is then cleaned and sealed. Depending on the severity of the damage, medication may be placed in the tooth to heal an infection and the tooth will be sealed in a separate visit a week later. If the tooth was badly damaged, a crown or other restorative measure may be necessary to protect the tooth from future damage and restore it to optimal function.\n    </p>",
