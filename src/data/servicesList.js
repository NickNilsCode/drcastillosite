      <span>Tooth Implant Dentistry with Dr. Luis Castillo</span><br/>
      Though dental care has improved immensely, many Americans still suffer from tooth loss. Tooth decay, gum disease, or injury lead to missing teeth and gaps between teeth. Dentures used to be the only option for missing teeth but with a success rate around 98 percent, dental implants are a great option for those with missing teeth who are healthy enough for oral surgery.<br/>
      Used to replaced one tooth or a set of missing teeth, many patients prefer dental implants to other tooth loss solutions because they look and feel like natural teeth. The greatest benefit to implants, however, is that they do not require invasive alterations to surrounding teeth. Because they can stand alone, neighboring teeth are left healthy and untouched.</br/>
      <span>Benefits of Dental Implants</span></br>
      Dental implants offer improved function and look when compared to bridges and dentures, including:<br/>
      - Appearance – dental implants look, feel, and fit like natural teeth, so no one will know they aren’t real.<br/>
      - Speech and Eating – because dental implants are permanent, they do not slip while speaking or eating. Patients also like that they are permanent so they don’t have to remove them to clean them or eat.<br/>
      - Durability – with proper care, dental implants can last forever, compared to five to seven years for dental bridges.<br/>
      - Oral health – other prosthetic solutions require reducing the other teeth. Implants leave surrounding teeth intact and fully functional. And as an added bonus – implants can’t get cavities!<br/>
      - Comfort – patients report dental implants are more comfortable than removable dentures. They are also more predictable due to their reliable, long-term results and 98 percent patient satisfaction.<br/>
      - A beautiful face – dental implants help support and maintain the natural look of your face. Missing teeth can cause your face to sag and appear sunken and older.<br/>
      <span>Dental Implant Process</span><br/>
      Dr. Castillo will develop an individualized treatment plan to address your specific needs. A tiny post made of titanium will be placed in the gum and over the next several months, the implant will integrate with the jawbone. Once the implant has bonded to the gums, another post will be placed to securely hold the tooth. A new tooth or teeth will be made of an impression of your teeth.<br/>
      The replacement tooth or crown will then be attached to the post. The new teeth will be made to match the color of your natural teeth and will look, feel, and act just as a normal tooth. The result is a natural and beautiful looking smile.<br/>
      <span>Schedule an Appointment</span><br/>
      If you are missing teeth or are tired of removing your dentures all the time, contact Dr. Castillo for a consultation to discuss dental implants.

Dr. Castillo and his entire office staff in Fresno, CA, work to cultivate a warm, inviting, and friendly atmosphere.,

      Orthodontics is a type of dentistry that aligns the teeth and jaw to improve a person’s overall oral health and give them a straighter, more functional smile. Dr. Castillo offers braces for both adolescent and adult patients to achieve a beautiful smile.<br/>
      <span>Benefits of Orthodontics</span><br/>
      Failing to correct a misaligned or abnormal bite can result in oral health issues later in life. This can include tooth decay, gum disease, tooth loss, affected speech and chewing, wear to tooth enamel, or jaw issues. Benefits include a healthier mouth, more beautiful smile, and teeth that last a lifetime.<br/>
      <span>Traditional Braces</span><br/>
      Traditional metal braces consist of brackets, elastic bands, and wires. Brackets are bonded to the teeth and wires are strung through the brackets. Small elastic bands will secure the wires to the brackets. The elastic bands come in many colors for kids and teenagers and clear and silver styles for adults. Though braces can be uncomfortable at first and limit what you can eat, they are the most effective way to straighten the teeth. After the braces are removed, you will wear a retainer to keep the teeth in their straight position.<br/>
      <span>Schedule an Appointment</span><br/>
      If you or your child has crooked teeth, Dr. Castillo and his Fresno, CA office can help. Orthodontic braces are the best way to get the beautiful smile you deserve. Straightening a child’s teeth while they are young sets them up for a lifetime of straight and functional teeth. Dr. Castillo is excited to help you begin the journey to straight teeth.

      Visiting the dentist twice a year is very important for your oral health. What can start as a small cavity can quickly grow into an expensive and painful tooth removal or root canal procedure. Many American adults have some form of gingivitis or gum disease – an infection of the gums and bones surrounding the teeth. Regular dental checkups are important in preventing gum disease and tooth decay. Gum disease can lead to other health concerns such as diabetes or heart disease. Dr. Castillo works with health care practitioners in the area to address health issues comprehensively to assist each patient with their overall health.<br/>
      We are using best materials according to the latest hygiene and treatment standards A general dental visit begins with a thorough cleaning and comprehensive examination. Digital x-rays may be taken to identify underlying issues such as tooth decay or bite disorders. Fixing complex dental issues such as TMJ disorders or bite disorders can actually help other health concerns such as headaches, teeth grinding, or discomfort. Dr. Castillo will discuss your dental concerns and cosmetic goals.<br/>
