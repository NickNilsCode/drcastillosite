      Dental bridges are a bridge that close the gap created by one or more missing teeth. A great way to replace missing teeth, dental bridges are made up of two or more crowns for the teeth on either side of the gap. Missing teeth make the face appear sunken, cause difficulty chewing and speaking, and often embarrass people. Dr. Castillo and his friendly Fresno, CA office staff work hard to create a personalized treatment plan for your missing teeth, giving you a gorgeous and complete smile.<br/>
      <span>Benefits of Bridges</span>
      Dental bridges are a great way to:<br/>
      - Restore your smile<br/>
      - Maintain and enhance the shape of your face<br/>
      - Correct the bite<br/>
      - Prevent remaining teeth from shifting<br/>
      - Give you a beautiful smile
    </p>`

  blurbRight:
    `<p>Dental bridges are placed over two procedures. During the first visit, Dr. Castillo will reshape the surrounding teeth by removing a portion of the enamel and making room for a crown to be placed over the existing teeth, creating the ends of the bridge. Impressions will be taken of the teeth and you will wear a temporary bridge to protect the teeth while your permanent bridge is being made. During the second visit, the temporary bridge is removed and the permanent bridge is attached to the crowns. Dr. Castillo will check the bridge for fit and look. Permanent dental bridges can last up to 7-10 years.</p>

      Similar to porcelain veneers, Lumineers transform your smile by correcting damaged, chipped, spaced, or stained teeth. Lumineers are thinner than porcelain veneers and do not require the irreversible removal of enamel from the teeth. Dr. Castillo is a trained and licensed Lumineers dental professional and is eager to help you achieve a beautiful, white, symmetrical smile.<br/>
      <span>Benefits of Lumineers</span><br/>
      - Resistant to staining – The material of Lumineers not only covers permanent stains but is also extremely stain resistant, keeping your teeth white and bright for years to come.<br/>
      - Can repair minor tooth imperfections such as chips, worn surfaces, or misshapen teeth.<br/>
      - Can cover old fillings that have become stained or discolored.<br/>
      - Can be used to close gaps between the teeth or to straighten the teeth, eliminating the need for orthodontic treatment<br/>
      - Lumineers are thinner than porcelain veneers and therefore require less removal of tooth structure.

    Lumineers are placed on the teeth over the course of two visits to the dental office. During the first visit, Dr. Castillo will create a mold of your teeth and discuss with you your intended shape and shade of the teeth. When the mold arrives you will come back to the office and Dr. Castillo will fit your custom Lumineers. They will be painlessly applied without the removal of healthy tooth structure. Lumineers are also completely reversible and allow patients to eat and drink whatever they’d like. With proper care, they can last for over 10 years.<br/>

      Fillings restore damaged teeth and help prevent further decay. Teeth may need a filling if they have been damaged by cavities, decay, gum disease, or injury. Fillings can also repair teeth that have been worn down from nail biting or teeth grinding. Dr. Castillo performs metal free fillings for patients in Fresno, CA. He works to make patients feel comfortable and at ease while in the dental chair.<br/>
      <span>Fillings Procedure</span><br/>
      To begin, Dr. Castillo will numb the area around the affected tooth. A drill will then remove the decayed area of the tooth. Once the decay has been entirely removed, the tooth is cleaned of bacteria and debris. Tooth-colored material is then applied in layers and a special light hardens each layer. Dr. Castillo will then test the filling for fit and that your bite is functioning properly.

      Since they match the teeth, they can also be used to repair chipped, broken, or worn teeth. These types of fillings also bond to the tooth structure, providing added durability. Less tooth structure needs to be removed to place tooth-colored fillings compared to silver fillings.<br/>
      <span>How Do I Know If I Need A Filling?</span><br/>
      Only a dentist can detect a cavity and decide if you need a filling. However, if you are experiencing tooth sensitivity or pain and have not seen a dentist in a while, you should make an <a href="/#appointment">appointment</a> with Dr. Castillo for a checkup.<br/>

      Brushing and flossing twice a day is essential for your oral health – but unfortunately it doesn’t always keep the teeth white and bright. Coffee, red wine, certain fruits, and even age, trauma, and certain medications leave the teeth yellow and lackluster. Dr. Castillo offers teeth whitening in his Fresno, CA office for those who want to whiten and brighten their smile. A quick in-office treatment can give you the beautiful smile you’ve been looking for – up to 4 to 8 shades whiter!<br/>
      <span>In Office Teeth Whitening</span><br/>
      Whitening your teeth through a dental office’s system is the quickest way to whiter, brighter teeth. Dr. Castillo offers patients a tray whitening system. First, an impression is made of your teeth. Then, custom whitening trays are created especially for you. Whitening gel is put in the tray, which you will wear over a short period time. The result is beautiful teeth up to 8 shades whiter! Though more expensive and intense than over the counter products, the result is much more dramatic and lasts longer.

      Grocery and convenience stores cell oral products that promise white teeth. Though they don't carry the same effectiveness as whitening systems offered by a dentit, they can whiten the theeth by 1-2 shades and are great follow up products after professional whitening:<br/>

      Dr. Castillo restores damaged and decayed teeth and replaces existing silver crowns with porcelain cosmetic crowns or onlays and inlays. These restoration options look and feel like natural teeth and help your mouth function the way it should. Cosmetic crowns give your mouth a uniform and beautiful look. Dr. Castillo prefers using cosmetic crowns because of their natural look and durability.<br/>
      <span>Inlays and Onlays</span><br/>
      Porcelain inlays or onlays are used when the damaged part of the tooth is too large for a filling but too small for a crown. They can help strengthen a tooth that has been damaged, helping patients bite and chew normally. They also protect the tooth from further damage and repairs. An inlay covers one cusp (or bump) of the surface of the tooth and an onlay, sometimes called a partial crown, is more extensive, covering two or more cusps.

      Though there are many materials Dr. Castillo can use to create a crown, porcelain or cosmetic crowns are aesthetically pleasing and durable. Benefits include:<br/>
      - No Metal<br/>
      – silver or metal dental crowns can cause discoloration along the gum line<br/>
      - Natural looking<br/>
      – made to match the natural tooth color, porcelain crowns look and feel like natural teeth<br/>

    `<p>
      Caused by bacteria, germs, and plaque on the teeth and gums, gum disease is an infection of the tissues and bones surrounding the teeth. It is also known as periodontal disease. Gingivitis is the early stage of gum disease and, if caught and treated early, is completely reversible. If gingivitis advances to gum disease and is left untreated the teeth may have to be removed.<br/>
      It is important to Dr. Castillo to catch gingivitis early, so he can restore your smile easier and quicker. Even if you feel your gum disease may have progressed, Dr. Castillo will help you feel at ease while discussing treatment options and treating you with the highest quality care.<br/>
      Dr. Castillo and his friendly and caring staff in Fresno, CA, office will help you achieve the attractive smile you’ve always wanted.<br/>
      <span>Gum Disease Causes</span><br/>
      Typically, plaque and bacteria causes gum disease. However, there are other causes that can lead to gum disease:<br/>
      - Hormonal changes including pregnancy or menopause<br/>
      - Cancer or diabetes can interfere with the immune system<br/>
      - Smoking<br/>
      - Not brushing or flossing daily<br/>
      Gums should be pink and firm, be flush against the teeth, and not bleed when brushing.<br/>
      <span>Gingivitis and gum disease symptoms include:</span><br/>
      - Red, swollen, and tender gums that bleed easily<br/>
      - Gums that pull away from the teeth (receding gums) resulting in the teeth looking larger<br/>
      - Pus coming from the gums<br/>
      - Loose/shifting teeth<br/>
      - Change in the way teeth fit together when biting
    </p>`

  blurbRight:
  `<p>
    To treat gum disease, Dr. Castillo may take several approaches. Ultimately, the objective of gum disease treatment is to reattach healthy gums to the teeth, minimize swelling, and stop the disease from progressing. To treat gingivitis, Dr. Castillo will perform an intensive cleaning, scaling, and root planning (<span>removing plaque</span>).<br/>
    Patients with gingivitis should follow a more frequent dental cleaning than the typical twice a year. Those with advanced gum disease may require surgery – flap surgery, bone grafts, sot tissue grafts, tissue regeneration, or bone surgery – are all gum disease treatment options.<br/>
    Treating gum disease will dramatically transform your mouth – both its look and feel. Many patients also choose to restore their teeth through implants or veneers or whiten their teeth after gum disease treatment. Dr. Castillo will help you devise a treatment plan to target the entire mouth and give you a beautiful smile that you deserve.<br/>
    <span>Schedule an Appointment</span><br/>
    To avoid costly and invasive treatment, it’s important to catch gum disease early. If you are experiencing symptoms of gum disease, contact Dr. Castillo for a consultation. A perfectionist who goes the extra mile, Dr. Castillo will work tirelessly to restore your oral health and your smile.",

  blurbLeft:
    `<p>
      Root canal treatments are used to repair a tooth that has been damaged, decayed, infected, or inflamed. Deep decay or untreated cavities cause the tooth to become infected and can begin to weaken the entire immune system. A root canal treatment can save a tooth that might otherwise need to be removed by removing the infected nerve and pulp and cleaning the inside of the tooth.<br/>
      <span>Root Canal Symptoms</span><br/>
      Signs you may need a root canal include:<br/>
      - Severe toothaches and pain while chewing or applying pressure to the tooth<br/>
      - Sensitivity or pain associated with hot or cold temperatures, even after the source has been removed<br/>
      - Discoloration of the tooth<br/>
      - Tenderness or swelling of the gum<br/>
      <span>Root Canal Procedure</span><br/>
      Many patients believe root canal procedures are extremely painful but with anesthesia and modern dentistry it is comparable to having a cavity filled. First, Dr. Castillo will take an X-ray to determine the location and severity of the damage. After numbing the area, a hole is drilled into the tooth and the pulp, bacteria, and decayed tissue and debris is removed. The inside of the tooth is then cleaned and sealed. Depending on the severity of the damage, medication may be placed in the tooth to heal an infection and the tooth will be sealed in a separate visit a week later. If the tooth was badly damaged, a crown or other restorative measure may be necessary to protect the tooth from future damage and restore it to optimal function.

  blurbRight:
    `<p>
      Though the affected area will be sensitive after a root canal procedure, a root canal will actually relieve your pain. Any post-procedure pain or sensitivity can be controlled with over the counter pain medications. Patients typically return to work or normal activities the following day.<br/>
